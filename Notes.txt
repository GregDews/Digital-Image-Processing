Possible libraries to replace matlab

numpy - for OpenCV
Scipy
Pillow?
OpenCV


Noise exercises?
    Gaussian Noise      Randn()
    Uniform Noise       Rand()
    Rayleigh Noise      a+sqrt(-b*ln(1-U(0,1))) //U is random? matrix
    Exponential Noise   -(1/a)*ln(1-U(0,1))
    Salt & Pepper       ?
                                Matlab uses natural log for Log method

Morphological image processing
    structuring element
        define small matrix with 1's for included points
    dilation and erosion, boundary
        dilation
            copy of B and shift this reflection by z
            keep the set of all values that are covered by B as
            the center is placed on every location of A
            (expand one shape with traits of other shape)
        erosion
            copy of B and shift this reflection by z
            keep only where B is fully covered by (contained in) A
            (shrink one shape by traits of other shape)
        open (A o B)
            erosion, then dilation
        closing (A â‹… B)
            dilation, then erosion
        
    fill the hole
        use of dilation/erosion with various sizes to fill in specified shapes

    convex hull

    mathematical Morphology
        set theory
            not - obvious
            and - only overlapping area
            or  - combined total
            xor - cut out union but keep indiv.
